# React Native TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')

This repository demonstrates a common React Native error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')` and how to fix it. This error typically arises when you attempt to iterate over an array or object that is currently undefined.  The example shows how using asynchronous data fetching can cause this problem.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
4. Observe the error in the console.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the data is properly loaded before attempting to render components that depend on it. This is typically done by checking for `undefined` or `null` values, or using conditional rendering.
